Click me style fake virus program for macOS

It is a fake click me style virus program that does nothing but counts down for 2 minutes and scares the user that its files will be encrypted.

The experience is gamified. There is a red button that ads 5 seconds to the timer when the user manages to click it. Be quick it only appears for one second.

If you wish to modify the timer download it to your Xcode and set the seconds to a desired time.

Otherwise feel free to download the latest version from the releases tab:
